# Prompt Snippets

Mix-and-match single-purpose prompt rules that are prepended or appended to
your message when you send it. Unlike skills, each snippet is a tiny,
standalone instruction — toggle exactly the ones you want per message.

## Usage

- Press **alt+s** or run **/snippets** to open the toggle menu.
  - `up`/`down` to navigate, `space` to toggle, `enter` to apply, `esc` to cancel.
  - `tab` previews the highlighted snippet (name, placement, order, filename,
    and full body; `up`/`down` scroll long bodies). `tab` or `esc` returns to
    the list with your cursor position preserved.
  - The menu is framed with top/bottom border lines and scrolls when the list
    exceeds the viewport (max height adapts to your terminal), with
    `↑ n more` / `↓ n more` indicators when clipped.
- Active snippets show up as a widget above the editor:
  - `↑ prepend: ...` (accent color) — inserted before your message
  - `↓ append: ...` (warning color) — inserted after your message
- When you send a message, active snippet bodies are merged into the message
  text: prepend group (sorted by `order`) → your text → append group (sorted
  by `order`), separated by blank lines.
- Toggles reset to **all off** after each send and at session start.

## Included snippets

- **Orient, then wait** — orient in the project and wait for the next instruction.
- **Clarify and verify** — clarify unclear intent and verify critical facts.
- **Delegate heavy work** — delegate broad exploration and mechanical work.
- **Diagnose only** — investigate and propose a fix without changing code.
- **Run unattended** — complete work without routine check-ins; ask only for a true blocker or named final approval.

## Local usage record

When selected snippets transform a sent message, the extension appends one content-free
JSON Lines record to `prompt-snippets-usage.jsonl` under `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` or
`~/.pi/agent`. Each record contains only `version`, `timestamp`, `sessionId`, and
ordered `snippetIds`. The extension creates the directory only on the first recorded
use. The writer rejects symbolic links for the agent directory, its parent, and the
usage file. Local write failures do not affect the sent message. The input transform does
not wait for the write, so the audit treats usage counts as a lower bound.

## Snippet files

Snippets live in `snippets/` next to `index.ts` — one markdown file each,
with frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: Concise
description: Keep answers short and to the point
placement: prepend
order: 10
---
Keep your response concise. Skip preamble and unnecessary explanation.
```

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | no | Display name; defaults to the filename without `.md` |
| `description` | no | Shown next to the name in the toggle menu |
| `placement` | no | `prepend` or `append` (default: `append`) |
| `order` | no | Number; sorts snippets within their group, in the menu and in the applied text (default: `9999`, ties broken by name) |

Files are re-scanned every time the menu opens and every time a message is
sent, so edits take effect immediately — no `/reload` needed.
